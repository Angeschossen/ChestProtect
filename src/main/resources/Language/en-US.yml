# ###############################
# About chat message type system:
# Does only work for messages in
# "message" or "command" section.
# ###############################
#
# You can use some codes to set the type
# of a message to title, actionbar or chat.
# How does it work:
#
# For example we want to print a message as a title:
# Set message to: '#t#Title[newline]Subtitle'(Set "#t#" in front of it; use [newline] to set the subtitle)
#
# You also send a message at the actionbar:
# Set message to: '#a#This is a actionbar message.'
# (Set #a# in front of it.)
